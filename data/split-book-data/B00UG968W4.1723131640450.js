window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In 1958, a successful businessman named Robert Monroe began to have experiences that drastically altered his life. Unpredictably, and without his willing it, Monroe found himself leaving his physical body to travel via a \"second body\" to locales far removed from the physical and spiritual realities of his life. He was inhabiting a place unbounded by life or death. </p> <p>Monroe recorded these experiences in two best-selling, landmark books, <i>Journeys Out of the Body</i> and <i>Far Journeys</i>. <i>Ultimate Journey</i>, his final and career-defining work, takes us further than we thought possible - and reveals to us what it all means. </p> <p><i>Ultimate Journey</i> charts that area which lies \"over the edge,\" beyond the limits of the physical world. It presents us with a map of the \"interstate\" - the route that opens to us when we leave our physical lives, with their entry and exit ramps, their signposts and their hazards. It also tells us how Monroe found the route and travelled it, and uncovered the reason and the purpose of this pioneering expedition. It is a journey that reveals basic truths about the meaning and purpose of life - and of what lies beyond. </p> <p>After six hardcover printings, the trade paperback edition of <i>Ultimate Journey</i>, will offer an even wider range of readers this exhilarating reading experience, the masterwork of one of the most daring and original thinkers and explorers of our time. </p>";
