window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>James Bamford, the bestselling author of </b><b><i>The Puzzle Palace </i></b><b>and </b><b><i>Body of Secrets</i></b><b>, unveils a hidden cabal of foreign powers that have spied against America to reveal the incredible spygames, secrets, and cyberweapons they’ve hatched, unlocked, and stolen—and how U.S. intelligence has utterly failed to stop them.</b></p> <p><i>Spyfail</i> is about the highly dangerous and growing capability of foreign countries to conduct large-scale espionage within the United States and how the FBI and other agencies have failed to prevent it. These covert operations involve a variety of foreign countries—North Korea, Russia, Israel, China, and others—and include cyberattacks, espionage, psychological warfare, the infiltration of presidential campaigns, the smuggling of nuclear weapons components, and other incredibly nefarious actions. </p> <p>With his trademark deep investigative style, James Bamford digs as deep as one can go into these clandestine invasions and attacks, uncovering who’s involved, how these spygames were carried out, and why none of this was stopped. Full of revelations, <i>Spyfail</i> includes access to previously secret and withheld documents, such as never-before-seen parts of the Mueller Report, and interviews with confidential sources. </p> <p>Throughout this stunning, eye-opening account, <i>Spyfail</i> demonstrates again and again how large a role politics, special interests, and corruption play in allowing these shocking foreign intrusions to continue—leaving America and its secrets vulnerable and undefended.</p>";
