window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Transform your life. Rewrite your destiny. </p> <p>In his most personal novel to date, internationally best-selling author Paulo Coelho returns with a remarkable journey of self-discovery. Like the main character in his much-beloved <i>The Alchemist</i>, Paulo is facing a grave crisis of faith. As he seeks a path of spiritual renewal and growth, he decides to begin again: to travel, to experiment, to reconnect with people and the landscapes around him. </p> <p>Setting off to Africa, and then to Europe and Asia via the Trans-Siberian Railway, he initiates a journey to revitalize his energy and passion. Even so, he never expects to meet Hilal. A gifted young violinist, she is the woman Paulo loved five hundred years before - and the woman he betrayed in an act of cowardice so far-reaching that it prevents him from finding real happiness in this life. Together they will initiate a mystical voyage through time and space, traveling a path that teaches love, forgiveness, and the courage to overcome lifeâ€™s inevitable challenges. Beautiful and inspiring, <i>Aleph</i> invites us to consider the meaning of our own personal journeys: Are we where we want to be, doing what we want to do? </p> <p>Some books are read. <i>Aleph</i> is lived. </p>";
