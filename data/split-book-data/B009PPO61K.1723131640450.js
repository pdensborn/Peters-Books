window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Spanning the years 1940 to 1965, <i>Defender of the Realm,</i> the third volume of William Manchester’s <i>The Last Lion,</i> picks up shortly after Winston Churchill became prime minister - when his tiny island nation stood alone against the overwhelming might of Nazi Germany. The Churchill portrayed by Manchester and Reid is a man of indomitable courage, lightning-fast intellect, and an irresistible will to action. </p> <p>This volume brilliantly recounts how Churchill organized his nation’s military response and defense, compelled President Roosevelt to support America’s beleaguered cousins, and personified the \"never surrender\" ethos that helped the Allies win the war, while at the same time adapting himself and his country to the inevitable shift of world power from the British Empire to the United States. </p> <p>More than 20 years in the making, <i>The Last Lion</i> presents a revelatory and unparalleled portrait of this brilliant, flawed, and dynamic leader. This is popular history at its most stirring.</p>";
