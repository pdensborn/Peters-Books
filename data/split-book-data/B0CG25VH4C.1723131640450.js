window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In July 2008, I received a phone call from a young man in his 20s who had just returned from Brazil, where he had a contact experience with a human-looking group of extraterrestrials he referred to as Nordics. In the following 15 years, I took extensive notes and recorded many of our conversations about his inventions and experiences on antigravity spacecraft belonging to either extraterrestrials or a USAF Secret Space Program (SSP) that took him to exotic locations on Earth and in outer space.</p> <p>In 2015, he began sending me photographs of spacecrafts he either witnessed or had been taken on. His extraterrestrial contact experiences led to him being encouraged by covert US Air Force operatives to join the US military as a means for giving him deeper access to SSP projects, which he finally did in late 2019. He currently serves with distinction in the US Army and has been given permission to reveal his experiences in covert missions on the condition he maintains his anonymity. Hence, I will refer to him as JP.</p> <p>This book chronicles my communications with JP and examines the entire sequence of photos he has taken of antigravity spacecraft belonging to an USAF or Space Command-run SSP. Finally, I present his participation in multiple classified SSP missions while serving in the US military and his continued encounters with Nordic extraterrestrials. To my knowledge, JP is the first active member of the US military that has been allowed to come forward to share his experiences of classified missions involving ancient artifacts on Earth or in space and extraterrestrial contact.</p> <p>Michael Salla, PhD</p>";
